<h3>
  About Us:
</h3>


We are a page dedicated to finding the most adorable (and possibly atrocious) pets in the world
and matching them against one another to answer the age-old question, are cats or dogs better? We are
empowered by fan submissions and in dire times we do peruse r/cat and r/dog. Our "matches" are changed everyday
We always post our winners on the aforementioned Reddit's to usual the chagrin of the internet. That being said,
we rely on users like you to give our little silly website a quick once over if possible, select a match that
interests you to learn about the candidates and then from there make an informed decision on which animal you think is
cuter
I.E. Cats Vs. Dogs! Just please have fun and if possible do all 5 match ups every day!
